# Blazor JS Interop demo

SDK version is fixed in `global.json` (update it or remove it as needed).

Chart.js and the custom JS code are imported statically in App.razor.

There is an unfinished Wasm demo showing the in-process variants in the Wasm client.

To run:

```pwsh
dotnet run --project ./jsinterop-demo
```
